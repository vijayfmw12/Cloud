LB Config:
Type of LB: ALB (http/https)
public facing or internal: public facing
global or single region deployment: Best for global workloads
LB Generation: Global external ALB
Create LB: you are about to create an ALB. (1-> public facing, 2. global.)

LB Creation: need to remember these 3 mandatory.


"Frontend -> Routings -> Backend (services & buckets)"

will start configurations in reverse order for understanding and full details.

#1. Backend:
************
1) whenever the traffic is coming, the page should be loading. so it is available in backend.
2) Two types:
	a) backend service
	b) backend bucket
a) backend service: we can select VMs, serverless, k8s services, cloud run.
b) backend bucket: instead of vms, will route traffic to blob (buckets).

3) backend service: 
	Name		: glb-backend-service-gui-cli
	Description	: glb-backend-service-gui-cli
	Backend type	: instance group (If we want to configure backend type, we can't pick indidually, it should be instance groupp).
	protocol	: HTTP
	named port	: http
	timeout		: 30
IP address selection policy: only IP4
	health check	: glb-healthcheck
:::Backends:::
Add New Backend	: 1st
	IP Stack type	: IPv4
	Instance Group	: glb-usa-mig (either of available group.)
	port numbers	: 80 (what ever we added in 'glb-usa-mig')
	balencing mode	: Utilization / Rate / Custom Metrics
			  ( distributing the requests)
	
	balencing mode	: Utilization
	Max backend util: 80
	capacity	: 100
			: Done

Add New Backend	: 2nd one
	IP Stack type	: IPv4
	Instance Group	: glb-singapore-mig 
	port numbers	: 80 (what ever we added in 'glb-singapore-mig')
	balencing mode	: Utilization / Rate / Custom Metrics
			  ( distributing the requests)
	
	balencing mode	: Utilization
	Max backend util: 80
	capacity	: 100
			: done


	Cloud CDN	: Disable.
	Cloud Armor	: None (info: can't create in free tier, its very expensive in paid ac)
	
Advance Config :
	Session Affinity		: None (recommended is "client IP/Generated Cookie")
						client IP = till customers ip didn't change.
						Cookie	  = whenever request started from end user, lb automatically creates one cookie in backend with expiry time. the request will come 							    to the same vm until the cookie expires.
	Connection draining timeout	: 300
	locality lb policy		: round robin (algorithm)
	Create				: Yes.


#2. Routing-Rules:
******************
	+ when customer hits main url 'icici.com', then it should go 'backends' -> 'backend service'
	+ when customer hits main url 'icici.com/images', then it should go 'backends' -> 'backend bucket'

(*) Simple host and path rule
()  Advanced host and path rule

Host and path rule: default as of now.


#1.Frontend:
*************
what we are providing to the 'customer'. 
We will share this "static IP" with the customer, so this 'IP' acts as a front-end in LB
this front-end is important.

Name		: glb-frontend-gui
Description	: glb-frontend-gui
Protocol	: HTTP / HTTPS	(https needs certifications)
IP Version	: IPv4
IP Address	: vijayfmw12-glb-ip
Port		: 80
		: Done

Review		: yes
Create		: Yes

=> Now LB has been created.
=> Now check 'static IP address in-use status' 
=> from now on words, access the application using static IP, it will show based on user request from region (either usa or singapore)
